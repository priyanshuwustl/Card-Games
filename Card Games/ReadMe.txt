# Card Games

Games included: FiveCardDraw, SevenCardStud, TexasHoldEm

Project includes classes for Card, Deck, Hand, Game etc. that can be used and extended to make further card-based betting games. The main program file that runs the games is Lab4.cpp.

Teammates: Priyanshu Jain, Glizela Taino, Jackie Wong

All teammates had a copy of the Card, Deck, Hand and Player classes before we started collaborating. The final versions were formed by integrating them. Everyone in the team contributed to most of the files. However, I did most of the code for the Game class (Game.cpp and Game.h) and that should be a good example of my coding style and practices.
